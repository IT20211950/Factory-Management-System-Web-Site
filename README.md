#### Brief Description of Project - â€œKaley Tea" Co (PVT) Ltd is a tea factory and is committed to delivering high quality tea to the 
local and foreign market. All most all the tea they produce are sold at the tea auction. The rest are distributed within the factory.

It takes a lot of time to supervise the workers in the factory, mark attendance, and calculate wages. But by automating the system, it is much easier for the client to prepare 
and manage all records. Then the relevant records can be re-examined, the errors in the payment of wages can be minimized and the factory can be maintained very efficiently.

#### Technologies used - Python using Django Framework
